# Import / Export Packs — Design Spec

Status: **IE1–IE4 shipped** (pure helpers + Selected-Rundown export + import
preview + safe non-destructive import). Designs how LiveLayer backs up and moves
data between machines (it's local-first, so this is the only way to share or
migrate).

> **Top-line invariant:** import/export is pure **control-surface data movement** —
> it reads/writes `localStorage` + IndexedDB only. It **never** touches `/output`,
> the realtime channel, or Take/Clear. Importing data does **not** auto-take
> anything on air. Frame the whole feature as low-risk because of this.

## Why

LiveLayer keeps everything in this browser's `localStorage` + IndexedDB. Operators
need to: back up before an event, move a setup to another laptop, and share a
service rundown with another media operator — preserving rundowns, Saved Graphics,
People, and the uploaded **logos/headshots** those reference.

## What we already have

- **Assets** in IndexedDB (`assetStore`: `getAsset(id)`, `getAssetBlob(id)`, `listAssets()`, `saveAsset(asset, blob)`); `LocalAsset` metadata is small (ids + a compact `dataUrl` preview), blobs are separate.
- **Saved Graphics** (`livelayer.presets` → `GraphicInstance[]`), **People** (`livelayer.people` → `PersonProfile[]`, asset ids only), **Brand** (`livelayer.brand` → theme), **Rundowns** (`livelayer.rundowns` → `{ version, rundowns }`, snapshots with ids + raw tokens).
- **Reference helpers** (`rundownReferences.ts`): `collectRundownAssetIds`, `collectRundownPersonIds`, `collectRundownTemplateIds`, `estimateRundownStorageSize` — the IE1 groundwork.

## Pack types

1. **Full Backup Pack** — all rundowns + Saved Graphics + People + brand + all referenced assets + version metadata. (Migration / disaster recovery.)
2. **Selected Rundown Pack** — one rundown + its referenced People + referenced assets + template ids + version metadata. (Share a service.)
3. **People / Assets Pack** — People profiles + their headshots/logos.
4. **Saved Graphics Pack** — selected Saved Graphics + referenced assets (+ their layout/theme/tokens, which are already inside the `GraphicInstance`).

**Recommendation:** ship **Selected Rundown Pack** first (the highest-value sharing
use case and the smallest surface), then Full Backup. People/Assets and Saved
Graphics packs are thin variations of the same machinery — add as needed.

## File format — `.livelayerpack` (ZIP)

A ZIP archive (binary blobs belong in a real container, not base64):

```
livelayer-pack/
  livelayer-pack.json        ← manifest (records, ids only)
  assets/
    <assetId>.png
    <assetId>.webp
```

**Dependency:** add **`fflate`** (~8KB gzipped, MIT, tree-shakeable, sync zip/unzip)
at IE2. It's the one justified new dependency. **Base64-in-JSON is rejected** —
+33% size, the whole pack held in memory as one string, and we'd abandon it the
moment Full Backup ships. IE1 (types + pure helpers) needs no dependency.

### Manifest schema

```jsonc
{
  "format": "livelayer-pack",
  "version": 1,                 // pack-format version
  "createdAt": "2026-06-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "app": { "name": "LiveLayer", "schemaVersion": 1 },
  "packType": "rundown",        // "full" | "rundown" | "people" | "savedGraphics"
  "contents": {
    "rundowns": [ /* Rundown[] (snapshots, ids + raw tokens) */ ],
    "savedGraphics": [ /* GraphicInstance[] */ ],
    "people": [ /* PersonProfile[] */ ],
    "brand": { /* TemplateTheme, optional */ },
    "assets": [ /* LocalAsset metadata — file lives in assets/<id>.<ext> */ ]
  },
  "summary": {                  // precomputed for fast import preview
    "rundowns": 1, "savedGraphics": 0, "people": 2, "assets": 3,
    "templateIds": ["preacher-lower-third", "scripture-card"]
  }
}
```

Excluded by design (see Data safety): scripture **cache**, recents, diagnostics,
API keys, machine details, file paths.

## Asset handling

- **Collect:** for the pack's records, gather referenced asset ids
  (`collectRundownAssetIds` for rundowns; add `collectGraphicAssetIds(graphic)` and
  `collectPeopleAssetIds(people)` helpers for the other pack types).
- **Retrieve:** `getAssetBlob(id)` per id → add to the zip as `assets/<id>.<ext>`
  (ext from `LocalAsset.mimeType`); add the `LocalAsset` metadata to `contents.assets`.
- **Missing blob → warn + skip, never fail.** The asset is omitted from the zip; its
  metadata may still be included. On IE4 import, missing-blob references are cleared
  during ID remap so the imported graphic degrades to the existing
  **monogram/placeholder** fallback instead of accidentally pointing at an existing
  local asset with the old id. Export reports a "N assets missing" warning.
- **Dedup:** **not** in IE2–IE4 — remap every asset to a new id unconditionally
  (simplest, correct, non-destructive); re-importing the same pack twice duplicates
  blobs, which is acceptable. Content-hash dedup (SHA-256 of the blob) is an **IE5
  / Full-Backup optimization**, not a first-slice requirement.

## Import behavior — non-destructive via full ID remap

**Default and only mode for IE4: keep both / generate new ids.** Nothing existing is
ever overwritten. Import order is load-bearing — **assets first**, then records:

1. **Restore assets.** For each `assets/<oldId>` blob + its metadata: mint a
   **new** asset id, `saveAsset(newAsset, blob)` into IndexedDB, and record
   `assetIdMap[oldId] = newId`.
2. **Rewrite + import records** against `assetIdMap` (and a `personIdMap` built the
   same way). Then assign each rundown/item/graphic/person a **new** id.

### The reference paths that must be rewritten (the hard 20%)

Asset ids appear in **multiple** places inside a `GraphicInstance` — rewrite **every**
occurrence:

- `graphic.values.logoAssetId`
- `graphic.values.headshotAssetId`
- every value in `graphic.assetRefs` (e.g. `{ logo, headshot }`)
- `graphic.personId` → via `personIdMap`
- `PersonProfile.headshotAssetId`, `PersonProfile.logoAssetId` → via `assetIdMap`
- rundown `selectedItemId` / `activeItemId` → via the item-id map (or just clear them on import)

**Worked example.** A rundown item's graphic references logo `a1` and headshot `a2`:

```jsonc
// in pack
{ "values": { "logoAssetId": "a1", "headshotAssetId": "a2", "name": "Anna" },
  "assetRefs": { "logo": "a1", "headshot": "a2" }, "personId": "p7" }

// after import (assetIdMap {a1→a9, a2→aA}, personIdMap {p7→pK})
{ "values": { "logoAssetId": "a9", "headshotAssetId": "aA", "name": "Anna" },
  "assetRefs": { "logo": "a9", "headshot": "aA" }, "personId": "pK" }
```

Imported records get fresh ids, so they coexist with existing data; `activeItemId`
is cleared on import (nothing is live on import), `selectedItemId` is set to the
first imported item when available, and the imported rundown becomes the active
rundown in `/control`.

### Safe import (IE4) — current behavior

`lib/export/importRundownPack.ts` implements `importSelectedRundownPack(file)`.
It re-parses and re-validates the chosen file at confirm time, supports only
`packType: "selected-rundown"`, requires exactly one rundown in the pack, rejects
malformed items before any write, blocks newer pack/schema versions, and stages a
full in-memory remap before writing:

1. old asset id → new asset id
2. old person id → new person id
3. old rundown id → new rundown id
4. old item id → new item id
5. old graphic id → new graphic id

Write order is assets → people → rundown. If a later write fails, IE4 attempts a
best-effort rollback of the new ids it already wrote. URL assets are recreated as
URL metadata without fetching the URL. Uploaded assets with bundled files are
restored to IndexedDB as new uploaded assets. Referenced Saved Graphics are **not**
imported as standalone Library entries; rundown items remain snapshots and
`source.presetId` stays informational only.

### Import preview (IE3) — required before any write

Parse the manifest and show: # rundowns / Saved Graphics / People / assets, and
**unsupported template ids**. The latter is a **warning, not a blocker** — an
imported graphic with an unknown `templateId` already degrades gracefully (the
renderer returns `null`, verified in R6); compute it via `collectRundownTemplateIds`
against the registry. Operator **confirms** before IE4 writes anything.

## Data safety

- **Export only:** rundowns / Saved Graphics / People / brand / referenced assets.
- **Never export:** `livelayer.scriptureCache`, `livelayer.chapterVerseCache`,
  `livelayer.recent`, diagnostics, API keys, local file paths, machine details, or
  whole Bible databases.
- **Scripture text vs cache (concrete):** `graphic.values.verseText` **does** export
  (it's part of the graphic the operator built); the scripture **cache** does **not**
  — IE2 must not sweep `livelayer.scriptureCache` into the pack.
- **Licensing note (in-app + docs):** users are responsible for the rights/licensing
  of uploaded media and copied scripture text they export or share.

## Versioning & migrations

- Manifest carries **`version`** (pack format) + **`app.schemaVersion`**.
- **Newer pack than this app supports → block import with a clear message** ("This
  pack was made with a newer LiveLayer; update to import it.").
- **Older pack → migrate** (additive, the same forward-only pattern as the store
  migrations). Unmigratable → block with a message.
- A corrupt/invalid manifest → reject before any write (validation in IE3).

## UI placement

- **Library → Export / Import** is the home (a small section/tab alongside Saved
  Graphics / People / Rundowns). Import always opens the **preview + confirm** modal.
- **Rundowns → "Export this rundown"** — a per-rundown action (Selected Rundown Pack).
- **Setup → Backup / Restore** — Full Backup export + restore (the disaster-recovery surface).
- Keep the dock uncluttered: export is a button; import is button → preview → confirm.

## Implementation phases

- **IE1 — Pack spec + pure helpers. ✅ Done.** `types/exportPack.ts` (manifest +
  summary + asset-entry + warning types); `collectGraphicAssetIds` /
  `collectPeopleAssetIds` added to `rundownReferences.ts`; pure helpers in
  `lib/export/exportPackManifest.ts` (`createSelectedRundownManifest`,
  `buildPackSummary`, `safePackFilename`/`buildPackFilename`, `getPackAssetPath`,
  `encodeManifestJson`). (`validateManifest`/`summarizeManifest`/`remapPackIds`
  belong to IE3/IE4 — not built.)
- **IE2 — Export Selected Rundown Pack. ✅ Done.** `lib/export/exportRundownPack.ts`
  (`fflate` `zipSync`): snapshots the rundown (clears `activeItemId`), loads
  referenced People + asset blobs from IndexedDB, builds the manifest, zips
  `livelayer-pack.json` + `assets/<id>.<ext>`, downloads
  `livelayer-rundown-<name>-<date>.livelayerpack`. Missing blobs **warn + skip**;
  URL assets carry their `url` (no file). Export action on each `RundownCard` and
  the studio panel header. Reads localStorage + IndexedDB only — no `/output`,
  realtime, or scripture-cache access.
- **IE3 — Import preview. ✅ Done.** `lib/export/importPackPreview.ts` (`fflate`
  `unzipSync` with a name-collecting `filter` so only `livelayer-pack.json` is
  decompressed): `parseLiveLayerPackFile(file)` → `validatePackManifest(unknown)`
  (blockers: not-a-pack / wrong `format`, **newer `version` → blocked**, missing
  `contents`, missing `rundowns` for selected-rundown, non-array `assets`) →
  `summarizePackManifest(manifest, zipEntries)` (counts, rundown names, sample item
  titles, asset filenames; `findUnsupportedTemplateIds` vs the registry,
  `findMissingAssetFiles` vs the zip). Soft issues are **warnings, not blockers**
  (unsupported pack type, unsupported template, missing asset file, empty rundown,
  url-only assets). UI: **Library → Import** tab (`ImportPackPreview.tsx`) — choose
  a `.livelayerpack`, see the summary + warnings. **Strictly read-only** — no localStorage, no
  IndexedDB, no realtime, no `/output`; pack strings are React-escaped (never
  injected as HTML) and length-capped.
- **IE4 — Safe import. ✅ Done.** `lib/export/importRundownPack.ts` restores
  bundled asset blobs to IndexedDB with new ids, recreates URL asset metadata
  without fetching, remaps people and every known `GraphicInstance` asset/person
  reference, imports a new rundown, clears `activeItemId`, selects the first item,
  and sets the imported rundown active. Confirm-gated and non-destructive; no
  `/output`, realtime, Take/Clear, Saved Graphics import, replace mode, or Full
  Backup restore.
- **IE5 — Full Backup / Restore.** Export all; restore with confirmation; optional
  asset content-hash dedup; the **merge vs replace** decision (open question).
- **IE6 — Polish / QA.** Error states, large-file/memory handling, partial-failure
  recovery, docs, manual tests.

**Ship order:** IE1 + IE2 (export a rundown), IE3 + IE4 (preview + safe import).
Full Backup (IE5) comes after the rundown round-trip is manually proven.

## Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Large asset blobs / browser memory | Selected packs are small; stream/zip incrementally; Full Backup warns on size via `estimateRundownStorageSize`. |
| Corrupt pack | Validate manifest before any write (IE3); reject with a clear message. |
| Missing asset blobs | Warn + skip on export; degrade to monogram on import (existing fallback). |
| Unsupported templates | Warning, not blocker — graphic renders nothing, no crash (R6-verified). |
| ID conflicts / duplicate people/assets | Full remap → new ids, never overwrite; dedup deferred to IE5. |
| Copyrighted media / scripture | In-app + docs licensing note; user responsibility. |
| Importing a future app version | Block on newer `version`/`schemaVersion`. |
| Partial import failure | Import is staged (assets → records); on failure, roll back the new ids written so far, or import atomically per record with a report. |
| localStorage quota on import | `safeWrite` already swallows quota errors; surface a "storage full" message and stop. |

## Open questions (for the user — not pre-decided)

1. **Full Backup restore — merge or replace?** Merge (remap, keep both) is
   consistent with everything else; replace (wipe + restore) is what people often
   expect from "restore a backup." Recommend offering **both** with replace behind a
   strong confirm, but confirm the default.
2. Pack file extension/MIME — `.livelayerpack` (ZIP) confirmed?
3. Should People/Assets and Saved Graphics packs ship at all, or is Rundown + Full
   Backup enough for now?
